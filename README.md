# Hexlet Front-end Development course
These are my solutions to the more or less complex training tasks made during the [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io/) "Front-end" course.
All tasks are a courtesy of a Hexlet team, all solutions are entirely mine.

## Course contents
### 1. [Introduction to JavaScript](https://github.com/lazy-ocean/Hexlet-solutions/tree/master/1.%20introduction%20to%20javascript)
First if-elses, recursions, for- and while-loops and other work with the simplest types of data: strings and numbers. Export and import rules, pure functions, closures.
